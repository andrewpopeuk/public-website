This is our public website README.

This is Nick testing that it can be edited without cloning or anything. I just clicked the edit button and then committed my changes.

When you edit this in github directly it goes live straightaway.

## Friday's 6@6
This is the best run organised club evening of the week, when the organiser is not on holiday / working away / out for a meal. When he is there the run is very well organised, sometimes even 6 miles. Furthermore in the 2 years he has been organising it he has only lost one person. Written by Andrew Pope (the organiser) 7th November 2016.

## #buffsontour
I can copy from Word documents, although can't upload photos.

That said, I can't copy and paste tables, can do links but when I test the link I lose the page. Updates incredibly slow, interesting to see how easy to update race details.
