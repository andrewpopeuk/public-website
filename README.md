This is our public website README.

This is Nick testing that it can be edited without cloning or anything. I just clicked the edit button and then committed my changes.

When you edit this in github directly it goes live straightaway.

## Friday's 6@6
This is the best run organised club evening of the week, when the organiser is not on holiday / working away / out for a meal. When he is there the run is very well organised, sometimes even 6 miles. Furthermore in the 2 years he has been organising it he has only lost one person. Written by Andrew Pope (the organiser) 7th November 2016.
